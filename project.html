        <p>
        	To build and run the project from source, download the above .zip file or tarball and check out the README file. Prerequisites for building the project from
        	include <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a>, the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java 8 SDK</a>,
        	and <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Apache Maven</a>.

        	<p>You can also simply download a <a href="resources/triangulation-0.9.jar">prebuilt executable JAR file</a> of the application and run it in the usual way (<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java 8</a> required).

        	<h3>Future Work: Failure Cases</h3>

        	<p>The bulk of this project is in what I would consider to be a completed state. There are, however, a few things that are left to do.
        	   The polygon subdivision algorithm appears to be correct in all of the cases that I've tested, but there are a few cases for which the triangulation algorithm
        	   is incorrect. Despite multiple rewrites and intensive debugging sessions, I haven't quite picked up on the subtleties that I seem
        	   to be missing for these cases
    	    <p>

    	    <img src="resources/failure1.png"> 
    	    <p><font size=2>Failed to add diagonal at second-to-last event point</font></p><br><br>

    	    <img src="resources/failure2.png">
    	    <p><font size=2>Failed to add diagonal at third event point; erroneous diagonal at fourth event point</font></p>

    	    <h3>Future Work: Additional Visualizations</h3>

    	    <p>Additional work could be done to add extra visual information. I wanted to keep this project as simple as possible so that the core algorithms could be visually understood, 
    	    but the way that the algorithm-processing data structures are set up is such that we can peek "under the hood", so to speak, at each stage of the algorithm if we so desire. 
    	    Perhaps a more visually-inclined person than myself could pick this work up and figure out some additional interesting visualizations to add.</p>
