            <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm">Plane-sweep algorithms</a> are a fundamental way of conceptualizing an algorithmic solution to
                many problems in computational geometry. They involve
                moving a figurative hyperplane across an <i>n</i>-dimensional space, processing event points as we bump up against their physical location.
                Since we will be dealing with 2 dimensions, the hyperplane is in fact a line, and for our purposes we will refer to
                these algorithms as "sweep-line" algorithms. These algorithms tend to be intuitive in explanation, but can contain a lot of moving parts, 
                which leads to the fact that implementation details and deeper understanding can often be elusive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, an attempt is made at visualizing a two-phase sweepline algorithm for triangulating arbitrary
                closed polygons. The first phase of the algorithm decomposes the input polygon into simpler, x-monotone polygons,
                and the second phase further simplifies the sub-polygons by decomposing them into triangles.
            </p>

            <h3><i>x</i>-monotonicity</h3>
            <p>
                A polygon is said to be <i>x-</i>monotone if for any given vertical line on the plane, that polygon is intersected by that line at most twice. <i>Fun fact:</i> since monotonicity is defined with respect to a given axis, note that the example provided below is not <i>y</i>-monotone. If we were to run the algorithm from, for example, top-to-bottom instead of left-to-right, we would require a <i>y</i>-monotone polygon.
            </p>

            <br><br><img src="resources/xmonotonepoly.png">
            <br><br><img src="resources/nonmonotonepoly.png"><br><br>

            <p>
                As stated previously, this is a two phase algorithm. The second phase of the algorithm requires monotone polygons as input, so in the first phase we break down
                an arbitrary closed polygon into monotone polygons.
            </p>

            <p>
            	The process for doing this is by using a sweep-line algorithm with one event per polygon vertex. We literally sweep across the polygon
            	and any time we "bump into" a vertex, we process the event at that vertex.
        	</p>

        	<h3>Vertex Types for Event Processing</h3>
        	
        	<ul>
        		<li><b>Split</b>: Vertex is the left endpoint of both of its incident edges, and its interior angle is greater than &pi;</li>
        		<li><b>Merge</b>: Vertex is the right endpoint of both of its incident edges, and its interior angle is greater than &pi;</li>
        		<li><b>Start</b>: Vertex is the left endpoint of both of its incident edges, and its interior angle is less than &pi;</li>
        		<li><b>End</b>: Vertex is the right endpoint of both of its incident edges, and its interior angle is less than &pi;</li>
        		<li><b>Upper</b>: Given a counter-clockwise orientation, the vertex is the right endpoint of its "next" edge and the left endpoint of its "previous" edge</li>
        		<li><b>Lower</b>: Given a counter-clockwise orientation, the vertex is the right endpoint of its "previous" edge and the left endpoint of its "next" edge</li>
    		</ul>

    		<h3>Monotone Polygon Subdivision Algorithm</h3>

    		<p>First, we define <b>Fix-up</b><i>(v,e)</i> as follows: if <b>helper</b>(<i>e</i>) is a <b>merge</b> vertex, add a diagonal from <i>v</i> to <b>helper</b>(<i>e</i>).</p>

    		<p>Recall too that the event vertices are in a list sorted by x-coordinate.</p>


    		<h4>For each event vertex, <i>v</i>:</h4>

    		<ul>
    			<li>If <i>v</i> is a <b>split</b> vertex: let <i>e</i> be the edge on the sweep-line immediately above <i>v</i> and add a diagonal connecting <i>v</i> to helper(e). Let <i>e</i>’ be the <i>v</i>’s lower incident edge. Make <i>v</i> the helper of both <i>e</i> and <i>e</i>’. Add <i>v</i>’s incident edges to the sweep-line status.</li>
    			
    			<li>If <i>v</i> is a <b>merge</b> vertex: delete its incident edges from the sweep-line status. Let <i>e</i> be the edge now lying immediately above <i>v</i> on the sweep-line. Let <i>e</i>’ be v’s lower incident edge. <b>Fix-up</b><i>(v,e)</i> and <b>Fix-up</b>(v,e’). <font color="red">Make <i>v</i> the helper of <i>e</i>. *</font></li>

    			<li>If <i>v</i> is an <b>end</b> vertex: delete its adjacent edges from the sweep-line status. Let <i>e</i> be <i>v</i>’s upper incident edge. <b>Fix-up</b><i>(v,e)</i>.</li>

    			<li>If <i>v</i> is an <b>upper</b> vertex: let <i>e</i> be <i>v</i>’s left incident edge. <b>Fix-up</b><i>(v,e)</i>. Delete <i>e</i> from the sweep-line status and add <i>v</i>’s right incident edge. Make <i>v</i> the helper of its right incident edge.</li>

    			<li>If <i>v</i> is a <b>lower</b> vertex: let <i>e</i> be the edge above <i>v</i> on the sweep-line status. <b>Fix-up</b><i>(v,e)</i>. Delete <i>v</i>’s left incident edge from the sweep-line status and add <i>v</i>’s right incident edge. Make v the helper of its right incident edge.
			</ul>

			<p><font size=1>* This detail was missing from the algorithm source, but is crucial for the algorithm to function correctly<br>

			<h3>Event Types for Polygon Triangulation</h3>

			<p>Now that we have subdivided our polygon into monotone polygons, we can use the next phase of the algorithm to triangulate each polygon individually!
			   Much like with our previous sweep-line algorithm, there is only one event per polygon vertex, and they are sorted from left-to-right by x-coordinate.
			   The event type for this algorithm is a little simpler, but like the previous algorithm corresponds to the vertex's location on the polygon:
		    </p>

		    <ul>
		    	<li>The <b>leftmost</b> vertex (there can only be one!)</li>
		    	<li>The <b>rightmost</b> vertex (again, only one!)</li>
		    	<li>An <b>upper-chain</b> vertex</li>
		    	<li>A <b>lower-chain</b> vertex</li>
	    	</ul>

	    	<h3>Reflex Chain</h3>

	    	<p>A given vertex on a monotone polygonal curve is said to be a "reflex" vertex if its interior angle is greater than &pi;.</p>
