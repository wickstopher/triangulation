            <h3>Project Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm">Plane-sweep algorithms</a> are a fundamental way of conceptualizing an algorithmic solution to
                many problems in computational geometry. They involve
                moving a figurative hyperplane across an n-dimensional space, processing event points as we bump up against their physical location.
                Since we will be dealing with 2 dimensions, the hyperplane is in fact a line, and for our purposes we will refer to
                these algorithms as "sweep-line" algorithms. These algorithms tend to be intuitive in explanation, but can contain a lot of moving parts, 
                which leads to the fact that implementation details and deeper understanding can often be elusive.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, an attempt is made at visualizing a two-phase sweepline algorithm for triangulating arbitrary
                closed polygons. The first phase of the algorithm decomposes the input polygon into simpler, x-monotone polygons,
                and the second phase further simplifies the sub-polygons by decomposing them into triangles.
            </p>

            <h3><i>x</i>-monotonicity</h3>
            <p>
                A polygon is said to be <i>x-monotone</i> if for any given vertical line on the plane, that polygon is intersected by that line at most twice.
